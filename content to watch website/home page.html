        unique
        body :being a hero.in order to pursue his childhood dreams he trained relentlessly for three
        years,also lost his hair in this process.but because of this training as Saitama mentioned
        became extrmely powerful enough that a single punch is enough to any monster,alien or human.That
        is the reason he has become bored of fighting and always looks for a fight to have fun. </p>
