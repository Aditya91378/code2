        <P>The anime has a powerful Demon Emperor who sacrificed himself in order to stop the war between humans and
            demons.
            He was reincarnated after 2000 years. The main character is also known as "Anos Voldigod". After
            reincarnating,
            he discovered that magic had been depleted in the world. Also he finds out that the history of the demon
            world
            also his name has been altered.He then tries to recover the truth behind the things that has happened in his absense. </P>
